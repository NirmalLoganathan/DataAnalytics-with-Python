In this project, I have built a model to classify customers who are likely to churn (stop using the company's product or service). 
Data Preprocessing:
Before building the model, you performed EDA (exploratory data analysis) to find the important variables that contribute to churn. 
I have also performed oversampling to balance the dataset, as the number of churned customers was significantly lower than the number of non-churned customers trained the model using logistic regression, SVM, and XGBoost. The final model was selected based on the highest f1 score.
The f1 score for the final model was 89. This indicates that the model is able to accurately classify churned and non-churned customers with a high degree of accuracy.
